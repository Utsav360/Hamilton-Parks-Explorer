Application Name : Hamilton Park Explorer

Application user by :  Someome who wants to know the locations of parks in the city of Hamilton.


Extra Feature added by me which can't be go over with our in-class examples :  

For other than of using class example I used the Print page view by calling the window.print() method 
as well as I used the example from google Javascript API direction code to modify it which 
gives the user to enter starting location and used dropdown to select the park .
Additionally after selecting both Start and End point it shows the direction of maps in driving mode.
